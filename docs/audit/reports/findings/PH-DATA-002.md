# PH-DATA-002: Full User-Data Reset Leaves Instrument Sample Packs Behind

- Lane: persistence
- Severity: P2
- Confidence: high
- Status: accepted
- Owner: remediation owner TBD
- Challenger: Codex, fresh isolated-fixture challenge
- Verifier: verifier TBD
- Affected runtime: both
- Coverage rows: DATA-014, DATA-015, OP-006, OP-009
- Related/duplicate findings: none
- First observed against: 808e6739e55b5186e8a9565f2c4e9267c4894a6c plus the chartered audit patch identity

## User Impact

The Delete User Data flow states that all user data was deleted, but installed
instrument packs survive it. Electron leaves app-owned pack files under userData,
while web leaves IndexedDB pack blobs and continues reporting them as installed.
The issue is recoverable but violates reset expectations, leaves potentially large
assets on the device, and creates desktop/web reset divergence.

## Expected Behavior Or Oracle

The charter includes sample files and IndexedDB-backed assets in durable-state
lifecycle and requires full user-data reset to cover files and browser-local state.
See CONTEXT.md and docs/agents/lumakeys-runtime-data-audit.md.

## Evidence

### Environment

- Commit/patch identity: charter baseline above.
- OS/runtime: Linux x86_64, Node v24.15.0, Chrome 149.0.7827.114.
- Data profile/fixture: fresh disposable desktop userData and Chrome profile under
  /tmp.
- Hardware: none.

### Reproduction

Desktop:

1. Create a sentinel pack file under a disposable
   userData/instrument-sample-packs/honky-tonk directory.
2. Run the same database reset and MIDI reset sequence used by the Electron handler.
3. The MIDI directory is recreated, but the sample-pack sentinel remains.

    {"samplePackFileExistsAfterDesktopReset":true,"midiDirectoryExistsAfterReset":true}

Web:

1. Start the built server against an isolated data directory and open it in a
   disposable Chrome profile.
2. Store an installed honky-tonk pack record in the production IndexedDB database.
3. Run the reset bridge request followed by the exact localStorage.clear side effect
   in SettingsScreen.
4. The IndexedDB record remains and webBridge still reports it installed.

    {"storedPackAfterReset":true,"statusAfterReset":true}

### Artifacts

- Desktop reset only clears database and MIDI storage:
  src/main/index.ts:336-342.
- Web pack assets are stored in IndexedDB:
  src/renderer/webBridge.ts:160-218.
- Web pack status reads that persistent store:
  src/renderer/webBridge.ts:417-430.
- Settings reset clears localStorage but not IndexedDB:
  src/renderer/components/SettingsScreen.tsx:1018-1030.
- Isolated reproduction commands/results: Phase 2 lane report, P2-DATA-002.

## Root Cause

Full reset owns SQLite, MIDI storage, and localStorage only. It has no coordinated
owner for the desktop instrument-sample-pack directory or the web IndexedDB pack
database.

## Recommended Remediation Boundary

Define the complete reset inventory in one runtime-neutral reset contract. Add a
desktop pack-directory reset and a web IndexedDB clear/delete operation, invoke both
from the confirmed user-data reset flow, and report any excluded data explicitly.
Do not alter normal per-pack removal semantics while fixing the full-reset boundary.

## Required Regression Proof

- Deterministic unit/integration proof: a full reset clears SQLite, MIDI, desktop
  sample-pack files, localStorage, and web IndexedDB pack records.
- Electron proof: disposable profile before/after filesystem inventory.
- Web proof: disposable browser profile before/after IndexedDB and status check.
- Data/recovery proof: a failed secondary reset step cannot falsely claim all data
  was deleted.
- Manual hardware/UI proof: confirmation copy and success/error state match the
  actual reset boundary.
- Broader regression command: npm test, npm run build, and npm run build:web.

## Challenge Record

- Independent reproduction attempt: desktop and web use different persistent stores
  and both retained the pack data in isolated profiles.
- Alternative explanations tested: localStorage is cleared correctly, but the pack
  store is IndexedDB and is not affected by that call.
- Scope/severity changes: none.
- Deduplication decision: canonical reset-lifecycle finding for sample-pack stores.

## Resolution

- Accepted rationale: exact runtime probes show persistent pack data after the
  product reports a successful full reset.
- Fix branch/commit/issue: not authorized during discovery.
- Verification evidence: pending remediation.
- Residual risk: user-data reset leaves durable pack data and storage usage behind.
- Revisit trigger: before any privacy/reset guarantee or shared-device release claim.
