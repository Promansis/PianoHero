# Audit Coverage Matrix

This is the objective denominator for the audit, not a findings list. Phase 7
consolidation has assigned every row an acting owner and an evidence-backed
disposition or explicit gap. Add rows when discovery identifies another surface;
never delete a row to improve the completion percentage.

## Row Rules

Every row must eventually have an owner, evidence reference, disposition, and links
to any findings. Allowed statuses:

- `not started`: inventoried but no evidence collected.
- `in progress`: owner is collecting evidence.
- `covered`: required evidence exists and has a disposition.
- `gap`: evidence is incomplete; the missing proof and owner are recorded.
- `blocked`: an external or baseline dependency prevents reliable evidence.
- `waived`: explicitly excluded by the audit lead with rationale and revisit trigger.

`covered` does not mean defect-free. It means evidence exists and any defects link to
canonical finding IDs.
