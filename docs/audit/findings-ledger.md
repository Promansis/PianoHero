# Findings Ledger

This is the canonical finding index. Detailed evidence lives in one file per finding
under `reports/findings/`, created from `templates/finding.md`.

## ID Format

Use `PH-<LANE>-NNN`:

- `WF` product workflows
- `MUS` music correctness
- `DATA` persistence/storage
- `PAR` runtime parity
- `SEC` security
- `UI` UI/accessibility
- `PERF` performance
- `ARCH` architecture
- `OPS` operations

IDs are never reused. A duplicate row remains and links to the canonical ID.

## Status Notes

Use this section only for cross-finding decisions such as a severity calibration,
merged root-cause cluster, or explicitly accepted risk. Finding-specific notes stay
in the detailed report.

- Phase 7 consolidation challenged all 18 findings. All remain accepted at their
  recorded severity and confidence; none was rejected, merged, fixed, verified, or
  moved to accepted risk. See
  [the consolidation report](reports/consolidation-2026-07-30.md).
- Phase 8 converted all 18 accepted findings into risk-ordered vertical remediation
  slices without changing status or severity. Implementation owners, verifiers, and
  branches remain a Phase 9 start gate. See
  [the remediation plan](reports/phase-8-remediation-plan-2026-07-30.md).
- Phase 9 implemented all 18 slices in the current worktree at commit
  `docs/audit-workflow` plus the chartered working-tree diff. Every finding has
  targeted regression proof (focused test fails before fix), typecheck, and
  proportionate builds proof. Status moved from `accepted` to `fixed`.
  Independent P0/P1 verification by another reviewer remains mandatory and is not
  satisfied by this implementation pass. See
  [the Stage 9 report](reports/phase-9-remediation-2026-07-30.md).
- Phase 10 froze the refactor at `d5839aa`, closed verification defects at
  `d4ba395`, restored a clean 318-test baseline, resolved BASE-SEC-001, and added
  package, Docker, browser/API, and real SIGKILL recovery evidence. Independent
  review keeps six P0/P1 findings at `fixed` because required runtime/manual proof
  remains; PH-OPS-001 reached `verified`. See
  [the Phase 10 report](reports/phase-10-verification-2026-08-07.md).

- PH-DATA-001 is the canonical cross-store atomicity finding for backup restore,
  song deletion, and full reset. Do not create separate findings for the same
  database-before-filesystem ordering without a distinct recovery root cause.
- BASE-SEC-001 is resolved by Hono 4.13.0, @hono/node-server 2.1.0, a passing
  unknown-length streaming-body 413/non-mutation regression, and
  `npm audit --omit=dev` reporting zero vulnerabilities.
- PH-MUS-002 is the canonical measure-map finding for non-4/4, tempo-change, and
  exact-bar-boundary loop behavior. Do not create separate findings for individual
  symptoms unless a distinct measure-map consumer has an independent root cause.
- PH-PAR-001 owns Electron renderer/package public-asset absence. Do not split
  curriculum, soundboard, menu, and managed-pack symptoms unless a later failure has
  a separate asset-location root cause.
- PH-PAR-002 owns browser file-input cancellation lifecycle for MIDI and JSON pickers.
  Do not duplicate it for individual import flows that share the same picker helper.
- PH-PAR-003 owns the Electron-only external-path fallback for migrated MIDI rows.
  Do not duplicate it for loading and difficulty-recompute symptoms.
- PH-UI-001 owns keyboard focus containment for all immersive session menus. Do
  not split it by Game, Free Play, or Soundboard unless a later overlay has a
  different focus-lifecycle owner.
- PH-UI-002 owns the Settings tab-row zoom collapse. Do not split it by affected
  tab or settings category.
- PH-UI-003 owns reduced-motion propagation into the Free Play and Soundboard
  canvas loops. It is not a duplicate of a general performance finding.
- PH-UI-004 owns the collision between modal Escape cancellation and the global
  Settings back shortcut. Do not merge it with PH-UI-001's focus containment.
- PH-ARCH-001 owns bridge-preflight failure visibility and recovery while opening
  a practice session. Do not duplicate it for score, fingering-identity, or
  immersive-dialog symptoms with their existing PH-MUS/PH-UI roots.
- PH-ARCH-002 owns renderer durable-setting outcome semantics. Do not merge it
  with PH-DATA-001 unless a distinct cross-store transaction failure is shown.
- PH-OPS-001 owns Docker build-context confidentiality for default user data and
  environment files. Do not merge it with runtime asset omission in PH-PAR-001.
